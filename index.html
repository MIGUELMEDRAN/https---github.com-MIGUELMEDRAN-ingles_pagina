      <p>This is my first post. I, <strong>Cristian Lopez Anaya</strong>, am happy to write in English. I want to improve step by step. I practice with short texts and clear ideas. I will talk about my studies, my job, my hobbies, and two important topics: <em>Critical thinking and media literacy</em> and <em>Crime and punishment</em>.</p>

      <p>I, <strong>Cristian Lopez Anaya</strong>, started to work in the health area more than three years ago. I met many doctors and specialists. Some of them spoke to me in English. They used short phrases, and I tried to answer. It was a good experience. I learned to be calm and to listen first.</p>

      <p>I, <strong>Cristian Lopez Anaya</strong>, love visiting restaurants. When I can, I try a new place. I like to taste different food and learn new words.</p>

      <p>I, <strong>Cristian Lopez Anaya</strong>, like to read short phrases and new words. I use a small notebook and my phone. I write the word, a simple definition, and an example. I repeat the words many times during the week. This method is easy and useful for me.</p>

      <h2>5) Traveling Through Language</h2>
      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507525428034-b723cf961d3e" alt="Traveling with language" />
      <p>Sometimes I, <strong>Cristian Lopez Anaya</strong>, cannot travel, but English takes me to new places. When I read an article or watch a video in English, I feel like I am in another country. I hear different accents, new stories, and new perspectives.</p>

      <h2>6) Critical Thinking and Media Literacy</h2>
      <img src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.LMnP7aLYKMG7uqyJhCghIgHaFB?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain&o=7&rm=3" alt="Critical thinking and media literacy" />
      <p>I, <strong>Cristian Lopez Anaya</strong>, think that today we read news and watch videos all the time. Some information is true. Some is false or confusing. <strong>Critical thinking</strong> means we stop and think before we believe or share.</p>

    <article id="crime-punishment" class="post">
      <h2>7) Crime and Punishment</h2>
      <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71klbk7X+AL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="Crime and punishment" />
      <p>I, <strong>Cristian Lopez Anaya</strong>, believe that every society needs rules. When a person breaks the law, there is a consequence. The goal is not only to punish, but also to protect people and teach better behavior. A good system is fair and clear.</p>
